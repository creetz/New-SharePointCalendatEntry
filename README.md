    .DESCRIPTION

    This script connects to multiple SharePointCalendar and creates events.
    
    The SharePointCalendars are managed by a settings.xml-File
    
    The events which will be created are managed by the csv-File.
    New-ShrePointCalendarEntry.csv
    
    My recommendation:
    Use multiple Teams/o365-groups and create sharepoint-calendarlists to share with guests and other-users.
