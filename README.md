  .DESCRIPTION

  This script opens multiple SharePointCalendar and creates events, which can be managed by a csv-file.
  Please use the example csv-file --> New-SharedPointCalendar.csv
  The SharePointCalendars are managed by the settings.xml-File.
  Please look at the setting.xml-ExampleFile, too.
    
  my recommendation:
  Use multiple Teams/o365-groups create multiple kalendar to share with guests and other-users.
